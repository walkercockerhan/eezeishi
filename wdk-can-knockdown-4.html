                            <p>Дурак Онлайн – сетевая версия известнейшей игры: теперь вы сможете сыграть с реальным соперником. Beside freezing stuff which colossus and interceptor can do just fine ( voltaic dome / Siegebreaker + Ice aura ) I have ranger 750+ Interceptor 750+ Storm 788 Colossus 788 I have Legendary thousand sun with 250% gear dmg it still barely scratch mob in gm3 while my 788 colossus just one slam ( air melee ) 46k + 26k and it AOE combo almost one shot trash mob in gm3 if i combo with Solvent Green it pretty much one shot trash mob in gm3 Colossus Suzette Taylor has a heavy punch. Boxing is a sport where two participants of similar weight attack each other with their fists (usually placed into special gloves) 
I really hope they fix the stamina it was so good before the patch they had made the right adjustments it was perfect because it punished spammers and made you fight strategically and smarter. Then for some reason they reverted back to the old way after the patch and now you knock down guys and it barely makes a dent in their stamina. It’s like what’s the point of fighting smart? I’ll fignt a guy like Jones who’s already OP, I knock him down 4 times to nil and yet his stamina is still buffed. Rice Girl. The Western is a popular dramatic genre found in books, films and TV shows throughout the 20th century. This movie genre turned out to be rich in depiction of fights in varied forms. Always feel like a badass when he slams it down, what do you all think. Disclaimer. Something I like to do is think/make up weapons, characters, etc for games and such. So I apologize in advance is seeing Warframe idea is something that you all don't like. Also, i'm not good at stats, so where you would have "This attack does 100 damage" I would have an "x" there instead. # Libre Libre is a Luchador/Wrestler themed Warframe that is focused on Finishers and Aggroing enemies. He should have good Health and Armor stats, but weak shields. I would draw a pictur. What a way to lure in people with appealing content, just to spit on their faces. Before I explain: this is not my first MH game and I have played the witcher trilogy. Here’s how this collab goes: “Oh man cool, you get to play as Geralt! Wow, investigating and stuff! Awesome visual with those pukeis! Cool mini quest with the Gaja!” Then the boss fight: “Wow, that looks cool AND spooky af! . uau, his stronger than he looks, challenged accepted! . he staggers me easily At level 3, you can knockdown or knockback an enemy as part of a flurry of blows. Big whoop right? Actually, yeah! You can knockdown or knockback anyone! That charging rhino? Stopped dead by a single kick. That humongous demon? Tripped face first into the mud. That gargantuan dragon flying overhead? On her ass in a pile on the ground. It might not accomplish 
360 degree one shot ability with crazy range + 90% damage reduction. Bugs will punish him once in a while. Definitely balance in a 20 vs 20 game mode. Give him a pull and a push so it's easier to throw non blockers off ledges. Push should have a long animation so people can forget how OP it is. Also a block break ability that can knockdown so that he can make all the other saber users on his team boring and useless. People will eventually learn to stop shooting So, I don't have videos of it, since I am unable to properly record gameplay, but if someone can record it and post it, it would be greatly appreciated. Essentially, characters with knockdown CC such as Shugoki, Shaman, Lawbringer, Raider, etc., can solo the Guardian or Commander and/or guarantee tons of damage for teammates. The Guardian and Commander do not dodge attacks. In fact, they do not defend themselves in any way except for super-armoring through attacks. Because Being valkyrie rework a "work in progress" as stated by the devs i decided to put together a valkyrie rework of my own, hearing the opinions of different players, proposing some suggestions to a dev team that didn't seem to be that on point with her rework, unfortunately, ruining her old flow and making some questionable additions, like hidden stance 2.0. Note; These changes would be applied to the current kit of the valkyrie. Quality of life changes Gb range back to prerework range. So, I just started playing a little bit of Valk. A Centurion can knockdown someone and take out more than half your health. When a Valk knocks you down, you get. 1 heavy 
Why does everybody say slayer is not very good? I mean in pvp i can Knockdown strike into a evasive roll (this is with castanic) to get behind them and i'd use overhand strike into Eviscerate and i would use overpower-heart thrust and i could one shot people with low hp (Brawlers, lancer, warrior, and beserker are the classes i can kill with this combo). Im just wondering why people say they suck but in reality they can 1 shot the main damage dealers/carries of the fight. Please https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92679/ (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92679/) Requiem - Knockdown tweak This mod makes all big enemy have knockdown ability with requiem's mess system, and those knockdown effect can be blocked now. The creatures can knockdown you : Dragon, Giant, Dwemer centurion, Frost atronach, Bear, Sabrecat, Troll, Lurker \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. Looks like a winded up haymaker that can knockdown to me. A jab would be a quick. well you know. jab. Truly an unnecessary nit pick, but ive always wondered. 
Let's jump right to it, people will choose the basic set "Iga" or "Scion of Virtue+Tatenashi" for this build. But this time, it will be a different one, my choice is Dragon Ninja. I go for this because of the 7th bonus, it's too good for kunai, a free 20% damage bonus, looks nice? STATS: you should focus on DEX, MAGIC and SPIRIT. Don't worry about the others, as long as you have CTA 3 stats I mention, you won't have any problem about lacking damage. Moreover, most your damage comes from kunai. This week Geomancy is up for discussion. If I don't get any requests next week will be Huntsman. Overview Offensive Spells Deal Poison or Earth Damage Generally cause Poisened or Slow status Poison heals undead characters Slow status from oil bypasses magic armor Some skills apply Acid status, which eats away physical armor over time Generally scales with Intelligence and Geomancer Defensive Spells Focus on increasing/replenishing physical armor. Warfare is up for discussion. Overview Offensive Spells Deal damage according to the weapon you use Scale with your weapon and attribute according to the weapon you use Possible status effects include knocked down and crippled Status effects inflicted by warfare skills are usually resisted by physical armor Defensive Spells Focus on restoring armor and taking damage away from allies Utility Spells Can clear ground effects and increase damage output. The knockdown system is a little awkward to me in requiem. A sabrecat can knockdown me(even I blocked with a shield!), while a dwemer centurion can never knockdown me. I'm looking for a mod that can make those giant creatures(ceturion, dragon, frost attronach.) get high chance knockdown me if I don't block, and make those animals knockdown effect be slightly and blockable. I’ve been playing a lot of hill climb racing 1 & 2 and have really been enjoying them. But they’re starting to become a little stale with how often I tend to play them. I’m looking for some other good physics game to play. Something where if there are upgrades in stages, your really able to feel the difference each stage makes. Or the actual movements can really be felt through the controls. I’m not looking for a particular genre necessarily, just anything with a good physics engine that’s. I'm looking to start focusing on a more tanky character to lead the frontline in groups, and I'm torn between Kruber and Bardin, i know Footknight is bugged right now, so let's talk as if his bugs aren't there. Ironbreaker seems to be the defacto go-to tank, with his ability to absorb a hit every 13/20 seconds being a godsend on higher difficulties, what with his drakefire weapons being (arguably) overpowered as well, meaning his horde clear his tremendous. Kruber seems to offer 
I think you never understood the mechanics of the game nor your own class skills. You only learn some combos someone taught you or you read somewhere. There is still a lot of possibilities to do with this scheme. Actually i think there are more consodering you can knockdown or up even if the opponent is on the floor. And for classes without any grab or just one thats is amazing. And classes with two grabs they can still use it. New scheme Stiffness as much as you can>(grab, knockdown Hi Guys, I wanted to make this thread to talk about Alisha's Artes. I honestly think she is one of the better melee characters in the game due to her versatile and multi element hitting abilities. Please feel free to indicate corrections in case i have posted any misinformation, or add your opinions of her artes as well. So without further adieu: 3 Star Artes Skewering Spear: A fairly far reaching stab that hits once, but is fairly powerful for only 4 CC. Can knockdown. Serpent. I've been playing around in Darksouls from the ages of Demon's souls (I know, it doesn't really count but hey, it just shows how old I am. :-P) and my favorite thing in all of the series has always been the dragon covenants. But it really has seen a lot of ups and downs over the series. it has seemed that every tweak has involved taking one good thing and nerfing it into the ground, then replacing it with a new thing, which then gets taken away entirely. Naturally this has spawned In order to maintain balancing and fairness throughout the entire map, instead of "uncommonly found around certain trees throughout the map" they should be attainable by any tree with a certain probability. Suggestion: Players can knockdown trees and have a possibility of receiving 2 apples. Trees with greater health have a higher percentage of dropping 2 apples. Ex: Tree Health: 600 40% chance of dropping 2 apples Tree health : 300 20% chance of dropping 2 apples Tree health OWT Important 1. By pressing the ability button again Mei can rotate walls (https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WeeklyPleasedArcherfish-mobile.mp4) and cancel them early 2. Mercy can cancel her Guardian angel 3. Payload heals the attacking team 4. Payload starts to move back automatically after some time without the presense of an attacking team. Being on a payload as a defender doesn't trigger or speed up this. 1. Holding an ability button during stun or cooldown will activate the ability Hello! I am here to open a discussion on GTA V/Online's game world and the possibilities of activity within it. GTA Online consists of major 3 branches: PvP, PvE and Free Roam. Rockstar tries to balance all 3 branches with every update so there is always something for every type of player in GTA Online. However, I feel like Rockstar permanently increases the amount of ACTION and COMPETETIVE activities within the game, activities that promote the PvP and PvE aspect and mostly require gunning. </p>
